First of all, welcome to Lisbon. We hope your experience will be fantastic! 

You are on the mobility page of DEI (hereafter CM-DEI). Técnico has a (fantastic) office dedicated to mobility ([NMPI](https://aai.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/nucleo-de-mobilidade-e-parcerias-internacionais/)) where you can obtain all logistical information, scholarships, application deadlines, regulations, etc. (contacts: erasmus@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (Erasmus Europe); outsideeurope@tecnico.ulisboa.pt (outside Europe). We, CM-DEI, only handle the documentation related to the academic component.

Coordinators: Prof. Luísa Coheur e Prof. Miguel Matos

Secretariat: Lucília Abreu

Contact: mobilidade@dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt

**Attention:**

- Do not contact us via our private emails — they will not be answered (always use mobilidade@dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt).

- When you send an email on a given topic, a ticket is opened. Please always reply in the same thread, that is, **always REPLY** to the first email you sent us.

- In case you decide to change any of the courses in your Learning Agreement, please carefully check the NMPI page and take the following into consideration:

a) You were given priority when choosing your courses, but if you want to change them now, **you will lose that priority** and be placed in line with other students who want to take that course (and some courses are almost always full);

b) Please note that **you must take at least 50% of your courses in MEIC/METI**;

c) Before sending us any document with changes, these must be validated and signed by your home university coordinator.

d) Also, notice that classes are held on **two campuses: Alameda campus and Oeiras campus**. When signing up for class groups/labs, make sure you are enrolling in the correct campus.
